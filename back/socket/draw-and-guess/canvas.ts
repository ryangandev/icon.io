/**
 * The drawing, kept where a late arrival can be told about it.
 *
 * The canvas used to live only in each client's memory: the server relayed
 * stroke events and kept none of them, so anyone who arrived after a stroke was
 * drawn — a joiner, or a player coming back from a reload — sat in front of an
 * empty board until the drawer happened to draw again. It was also why a
 * reloading drawer lost their turn rather than resuming it; there was nothing
 * to resume to.
 *
 * The undo rewrite already put the drawing in a replayable form. This is the
 * same stroke list every client builds from the same events, built once more on
 * the server so it can be handed to whoever turns up next.

/**
 * How many points a single room's drawing may hold before further ones are
 * dropped, by the drawer and by the relay alike.
 *
 * A full-tilt 90-second phase is on the order of 5,000 points, so this is well
 * clear of honest play — it is here because a modified client emitting
 * `continueDrawing` in a loop would otherwise grow this array for as long as
 * the room existed. Dropping the event rather than just declining to store it
 * is what keeps every client's copy identical to the server's.
