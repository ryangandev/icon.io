 * path got: it validated the *shape* of a payload and then broadcast it to
 * whatever room id it was handed. Room ids are not secret — the lobby list goes
 * to every subscriber and carries `roomId` for every room, locked ones included
 * — so a client that had never joined a room could draw on it, undo the
 * drawer's last stroke, or wipe the canvas mid-turn. `clear` was the worst of
 * them: one emit, and a stranger's drawing was gone.
 *
 * The rule enforced here is the one the UI has always shown: the canvas belongs
 * to whoever is drawing on it, and only while they are drawing.
