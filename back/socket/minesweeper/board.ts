/**
 * The minefield: the hidden layout, and the public view of it.
 *
 * Two conventions worth stating once, because everything else here assumes
 * them:
 *
 * - **Cells are a flat row-major array.** `index = y * width + x`. A board is
 *   at most 480 cells and goes over the wire every round, so it travels as one
 *   array of small numbers rather than 480 objects.
 * - **The public view is the only thing a client ever sees.** `-1` hidden,
 *   `0`–`8` revealed with that many mines adjacent, `9` a mine somebody hit.
 *   The mine layout never leaves the process, which matters more here than in
 *   Draw & Guess: a leaked word spoils a turn, a leaked minefield spoils the
 *   entire game and cannot be re-rolled.

 * the game - and here a mine does not end anything, so the reason for it is
 * gone. Keeping it would also make the first player's score a lie: risk is
 * scored from public information, which says the opening cell is as dangerous
 * as the board's density, and it would not have been.
 *
 * Nor is the board checked for solvability. Modern single-player generators
 * guarantee a board can be cleared without guessing; here guessing is the
 * scoring mechanism, so a board that forces one is working as intended.
