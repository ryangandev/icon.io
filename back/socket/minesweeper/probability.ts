/**
 * How likely each hidden cell is to be a mine, given only what everybody can
 * see.
 *
 * This is the whole game. Every score is a function of it, so it is worth being
 * exact rather than approximately right: the number returned is the true
 * posterior — the fraction of all mine layouts consistent with the visible board
 * in which that cell is a mine — not a per-constraint estimate.
 *
 * **It takes the public view, not the board.** That is a deliberate constraint
 * rather than a convenience: a function that could see the layout could score a
 * pick by whether it was actually a mine, which is exactly the thing that must
 * not happen. Being unable to cheat is better than being trusted not to.
 *
 * The method is the standard one:
 *
 * 1. Every revealed number is a constraint on its hidden neighbours: how many
 *    of them are mines. Mines somebody has already hit count against the number
 *    and drop out of the unknowns.
 * 2. The **frontier** is the hidden cells touching at least one revealed number.
 *    Split it into independent components — two cells are connected when a
 *    constraint mentions both — because components multiply rather than interact.
 * 3. Enumerate each component's satisfying assignments by backtracking, counting
 *    how many use `k` mines and, of those, how many make each cell a mine.
 * 4. The **sea** is the hidden cells touching nothing revealed. They are
 *    interchangeable, and are accounted for by weighting each frontier total `t`
 *    by `C(|sea|, remaining − t)` — the number of ways the mines the frontier did
 *    not use could be spread through the sea.
 *
 * Counts are `bigint` because they genuinely overflow: `C(300, 99)` has 82
 * digits, and a probability that silently became `Infinity / Infinity` would
 * make every score on a Large board `NaN`.
