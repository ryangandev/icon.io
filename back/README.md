## Technology Stack

-   **Node.js**
-   **TypeScript**
-   **Express**
-   **Socket.io**

## üõ†Ô∏è Set Up

-   If you are currently in the root directory, navigate to the `back` directory:

    ```zsh
    cd back
    ```

-   Install the dependencies for the backend:

    ```zsh
    npm install
    ```

-   Compile the server:

    ```zsh
    npm run build
    ```

-   Start the server:

    ```zsh
    npm run start:dev
    ```

-   The above steps start the server on port 3000. You will also need to start the frontend in another terminal to use the application. Refer to the [Front README]() for instructions on how to start the frontend.

-   If both the frontend and backend are running, you can access the application at `http://localhost:3001`.
