 * The outbound helpers are generic over the event map: a payload of the wrong
 * shape for its event fails to compile. The inbound ones deliberately are not.
 * A type says what a well-behaved client sends, not what arrives, so a handler
 * is handed its arguments as `unknown` and validates them with zod.
