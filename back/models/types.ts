 * the process: the word while it is being guessed, and the drawing in the
 * mutable form the relay maintains it in.
 *
 * The room itself is no longer described here. `RoomInfo` and
 * `DrawAndGuessDetailRoomInfo` were one type that mixed the two - a room's name,
 * seats and password alongside a drawer queue and a canvas - which is precisely
 * the seam the extraction cut along. What is generic is `Room<TGameState>` in
 * `libs/rooms/types.ts`; what is Draw & Guess's is `DrawAndGuessState` below,
 * and it hangs off `room.game`.
