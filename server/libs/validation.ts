 * game state, so a crafted client could ask for a room with a billion seats or
 * a megabyte-long name, and chat messages were unbounded on the wire even
 * though the input box caps them at 40 characters.
 *
 * The bounds below mirror what the UI already enforces, so a well-behaved client
 * never notices them.
 *
 * What is here is the room layer's: identity, lobbies, rooms, chat. A game's own
 * events are validated next to that game - `socket/draw-and-guess/validation.ts`
 * - out of the same primitives, which are exported for exactly that.
