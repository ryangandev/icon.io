## Technology Stack

-   **React**
-   **TypeScript**
-   **AntDesign**
-   **Socket.io**

## üõ†Ô∏è Set Up

-   If you are currently in the root directory, navigate to the `front` directory:

    ```zsh
    cd front
    ```

-   Install the dependencies for the frontend:

    ```zsh
    npm install
    ```

-   Start the development server:

    ```zsh
    npm run start
    ```

-   The above steps will start the development server on port 3001. You will also need to start the backend to connect to the server in another terminal. Refer to the [Backend README]() for instructions on how to start the backend.

-   If both the frontend and backend are running, you can access the application at `http://localhost:3001`.
