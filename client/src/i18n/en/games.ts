Every card has four features: its colour (coral, blue or ink), its shape (circle, triangle or square), how many shapes it shows (one, two or three) and its fill (solid, striped or outlined). Three cards are a trio when, for each feature on its own, they are all the same or all different. Two circles and a square are never a trio.

Twelve cards are on the table, always with a trio among them. Everyone looks at the same table at the same time, and there are no turns. Pick three cards; your third pick claims them, and nobody sees your picks before then.

The first trio claimed is taken, for 1 point: everyone sees it, and who found it, for 2 seconds, then three new cards take its place. Three that are not a trio lock you out for 3 seconds, and never cost a point. If nobody finds a trio for 30 seconds, one card of a trio is marked for everyone, and 30 seconds later a second.

The game ends after its 10 or 20 trios. Whoever found the most wins.

Everybody rolls their dice in secret, then takes turns bidding on the whole table: at least so many dice showing one face. Ones are wild: they count as any face, so nobody bids on them. About a third of the dice show any face, ones included.

On your turn, raise the bid or call Liar. A raise is more dice of any face, or as many dice of a higher face. You have 20 seconds; run out and Liar is called for you, or one 2 is bid if nobody has bid yet.

Call Liar and every cup opens for 5 seconds. If the table holds at least as many as the bid said, the caller loses a die; if not, the bidder does. Whoever lost a die opens the next round. Lose your last die and you are out; the last player with dice wins.
