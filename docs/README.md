## Ownership

Each fact has one home; everywhere else links to it.

| Document          | Owns                                                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AGENTS.md`       | Commands and rules that fail silently, each linking to its reason                 |
| `status.md`       | Current phase, direction, waiting items, next steps, open decisions, known issues |
| `architecture.md` | How the code works and why, per subsystem, and its pitfalls                       |
| `games/*.md`      | Each game's rules, scoring, settings and code map: the behaviour contract         |
| `design.md`       | Brand, the Figma file, the export pipeline, editing rules                         |
| `design/figma/`   | Generated design snapshot; never edited by hand                                   |

## Keeping it true

- Update the owning document in the same commit as the change it describes.
- Delete status items when they are resolved; git keeps the history.
- Keep headings stable: this table links to them.
- Put the reason for a design choice next to the subsystem in `architecture.md`, not in a separate decision log.
- Write one sentence per line in Markdown, and never use em dashes.
